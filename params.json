A true stab at a crowd-sourced language!\r\n\r\n### Status and updates\r\nRight now, we've got nothing! As we flesh out the language, finalize grammars, decide design paradigms, I will update this page and the repo to reflect the current status of our language.\r\n\r\n### Contribution\r\nIf you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and send me an email at kitfreddura@gmail.com\r\n\r\n### Coming Soon\r\nA online forum for communication and discussion, probably in the form of a dedicated subreddit!",
